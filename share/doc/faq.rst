Terminology
===========

What is pwncat?
---------------
   `pwncat <https://github.com/cytopia/pwncat>`_ is a sophisticated bind and reverse shell handler with many features as well as a drop-in replacement or compatible complement to netcat , ncat or socat.

   It comes with a Python Scripting Engine (PSE) that allows you to manipulate incoming and outgoing traffic to your needs. This can reach from wrapping current TCP/UDP traffic into higher protocols such as HTTP, FTP, Telnet, etc or even go to encrypting and decrypting your traffic.


What is netcat?
---------------
   netcat is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. The command is designed to be a dependable back-end that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and investigation tool, since it can produce almost any kind of connection its user could need and has a number of built-in capabilities. `[1] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat>`_


What is a reverse shell?
------------------------
   A reverse shell is a type of shell that is initiated from a victim's computer to connect with attacker's computer. Once the connection is established, it allows attacker to send over commands to execute on the victim's computer and to get results back. `[2] <https://triagingx.com/img/website_images/resource_images/776444019_detectreverseshell.pdf>`_


What is a bind shell?
---------------------
   A bind shell is a type of shell in which the target machine opens up a communication port or a listener on the victim machine and waits for an incoming connection. The attacker then connects to the victim machineâ€™s listener which then leads to code or command execution on the server. `[3] <https://irichmore.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/bind-shell-vs-reverse-shell/>`_
